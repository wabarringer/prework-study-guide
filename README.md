# prework-study-guide
A study guide for course pre-work.
# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

I was motivated to learn the basics of HTML, CSS and Java. In order to understand these coding languages better I created a study guide. It acts as both a way to take notes durring the boot camp course and to gain hands on experience while doing so. I learned that coding isn't as hard to grasp as I thought.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Each section contains note on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. Opening the DevTools console you can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics and choose one for you to study first. 

## Credits

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
